# Case Studies in Applied Experimental Psychology
Documentation of an amygdala-based functional connectivity analysis using Neurodesk.

## Download and tidy up data
downloading all the necessary files was time-consuming. To address this issue, we installed `datalad`, a data management tool to efficiently handle large-scale datasets.
```bash
pip install datalad-installer
datalad-installer git-annex -m datalad/packages
pip install datalad
```
This enabled us to download the dataset using the Neurodesk terminal. This made the data available in our own Windows system, as well as on Neurodesk.
```bash
# set current directory
cd neurodesktop-storage
```
