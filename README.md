# Case Studies in Applied Experimental Psychology
Documentation of an amygdala-based functional connectivity analysis using Neurodesk. We used the Terminal in Neurodesk to execute the code, as well as the interfaces of the programmes on Neurodesk (e.g. `FSL`).

## Download dataset
downloading all the necessary files was time-consuming. Therefore, we installed `datalad`, a data management tool to efficiently handle large-scale datasets.
```bash
# Install the installer
pip install datalad-installer
datalad-installer git-annex -m datalad/packages
# Install datalad
pip install datalad
```
This enabled us to download the dataset using the Neurodesk terminal, making the data available on our own Windows system, as well as on Neurodesk.
```bash
# Set working directory
cd neurodesktop-storage
# Download dataset
datalad install ///openfmri/ds000201
```
This downloaded the folder `ds000201`, including subfolders for each participant.

However, we then saw that when we navigated to our current working directory, the files were not downloaded. The files existed but were empty, so we could not open them.

To fix this issue, we had to download all of the data via `datalad`.
```bash
# Download all data in the folder ds000201
datalad get ds000201
```
The datafiles are very large, therefore, you can also download the data for one subject only, to try out the analyses on one subject. 
```bash
# Set wd to ds000201 which includes the subfolders per participant
cd ~/neurodesktop-storage/ds000201
# Download data of a subfolder, e.g. for participant 9001
datalad get sub-9001
```
## Tidy up the dataset structure
We did not know yet what the ideal structure of our data folders would be, however, we already deleted some folders including data that we would not need.

```bash
# Delete all subfolders 'fmap' in ds000201
find "~/neurodesktop-storage/ds000201" -type d -name "fmap" -exec rm -rf {} +
# Delete all subfolders 'dwi' in ds000201
find "~/neurodesktop-storage/ds000201" -type d -name "dwi" -exec rm -rf {} +
```
Next, we deleted the folders of the participants we would not be using.
```bash
# Set wd
cd ~/neurodesktop-storage/ds000201
# Remove specific participants
rm -rf sub-9002 sub-9002 sub-9003 sub-9004 sub-9005 sub-9008 sub-9009 sub-9011 sub-9014 sub-9020 sub-9023 sub-9025 sub-9026 sub-9029 sub-9032 sub-9033 sub-9036 sub-9038 sub-9039 sub-9040 sub-9045 sub-9046 sub-9047 sub-9048 sub-9049 sub-9054 sub-9058 sub-9064 sub-9065 sub-9069 sub-9075 sub-9079 sub-9086 sub-9087 sub-9089 sub-9093 sub-9094 sub-9095 sub-9096 sub-9098
```
Finally, we manually deleted the functional data of the remaining participants on the `hand task` and `sleepiness task`.

## Seed-based functional connectivity analysis
We used the [Neuroimaging core website](https://https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/fsl_fmri_restingstate-sbc.html), which provided us with a clear overview on how to create a simple seed-based connectivity analysis using `FSL`, which is also available in Neurodesk.
